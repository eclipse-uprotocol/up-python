# UPClient API (uP-L2 Interface)

The following folder include the Python specific Layer 2 interface definition along with example implementation for said interface. per the uP-L2 API specifications defined in https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-spec/tree/main/up-l2[uProtocol Specifications].

uP-L1 interfaces implements the core uProtocol across various the communication middlewares and programming languages while uP-L2 API are the client-facing APIs that wrap the transport functionality into easy to use, language specific, APIs to do the most common functionality of the protocol (subscribe, publish, notify, invoke a Method, or handle RPC requests).

This folder contains the uP-L2 interface and data models for Python that will be implemented by the various UPClient implementations.
